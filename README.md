# 🛡️ System Security Management (SSM) Project

## 📌 Overview
The **System Security Management (SSM)** project is a security-focused application designed to assess system vulnerabilities, manage user access, and implement secure authentication mechanisms.  

It is built for learning and practicing core cybersecurity concepts with both **Terminal-based** and **Tkinter-based GUI** interfaces.

## 🔑 Features
- **Vulnerability Assessment using Nmap**  
  - Performs port scanning and service detection  
  - Uses Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) for deeper analysis  

- **Access Control Management**  
  - User authentication and authorization  
  - Role-based permissions  

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
  - Implements **Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)** for enhanced security  

- **Encryption**  
  - Sensitive data encrypted using **Fernet symmetric encryption**
